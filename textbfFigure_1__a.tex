\textbf{Figure 1} . a) Weekly time series of suspected (color) and lab
confirmed (color) measles cases in municipal Sao Paulo during 1997. b)
Number of suspected (color) and lab confirmed (color) measles cases by
age in municipal Sao Paulo during 1997.

The probability of a clinical case being confirmed by positive IgM
serology was strongly age dependent (Figure 2). Clinical cases less than
20y were significantly more likely to be IgM negative (posterior mean
between 27-42\%\%, Figure 2); individuals between age 20-40y were
significantly more likely to be IgM positive (\textgreater{}50\%; Figure
2). The consequence of this bias is that the observed age distribution
of clinical cases over-represents the number of childhood cases.
