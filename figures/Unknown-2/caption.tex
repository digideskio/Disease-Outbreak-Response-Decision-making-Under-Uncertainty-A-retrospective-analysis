\textbf{Figure 5}: A comparison of four vaccination strategies in achieving the minimum vaccination threshold for reducing the effective reproduction number below one (estimates of threshold and 95\% credible interval shown by black lines and grey regions, respectively). 95\% credible intervals for the estimated effect of each strategy are shown by colored rectangles.
