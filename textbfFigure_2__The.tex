If we assume that the entire pool of susceptibles is from the local population (no excess susceptibles), the best fit model for 15 June data yields an estimate of \emph{R\textsubscript{0}} = 57 (95\% credible interval: 54-60). This estimate is not consistent with previously published estimates of \emph{R\textsubscript{0}} for measles \cite{EDMUNDS_2000,MOSSONG_2000}; thus we interpret this as a result of poor model fit and do not consider this model parameterization further (See supplement for details).

We fit the full epidemic model, including resident and excess susceptibles, using data through either 15 June or 15 July under the assumption that either all clinical cases were true measles cases or that true measles cases were a sub-set of the reported clinical cases, where the confirmation rate was determined by the age-specific confirmation model. The age distribution estimate of total susceptibles (both local and excess) was similar at both observation points (Figure 3a and b). The model fit using the age confirmation model consistently estimated larger numbers of susceptibles in the {[}0,5) and {[}20,25{)} year age classes and fewer susceptibles in the {[}15,20) year age classes (Figure 3a and b). Estimates of \emph{R\textsubscript{0}} from the 15 July data was 12.4 (95\% CI 11.5-13.5) for the age confirmation model and 12.75 (95\% CI 12-13.5) for model fit to
data using only clinical confirmation. The corresponding estimate using data truncated to 15 June was 11.75 (95\% CI 10-14) and 11.5 (95\% CI 10-12.5) for the clinical only and age confirmation models respectively.
